### Error Handling
15. ✅ **404 Not Found** (`*`)
    - Custom 404 page
    - SPA fallback to index.html for client-side routing

## Build Output Verification ✅

The following critical files are present in the `dist/` directory:

- ✅ `index.html` - Main SPA entry point (3.43 kB)
- ✅ `404.html` - SPA routing fallback (copy of index.html)
- ✅ `CNAME` - Custom domain configuration (jobbyist.africa)
- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- ✅ `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- ✅ `sw.js` - Service worker for PWA functionality
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` - SEO sitemap
- ✅ `robots.txt` - Search engine directives
- ✅ `ads.txt` - Google AdSense verification
- ✅ `JOBBYIST.svg` - Logo file
- ✅ `assets/` - JavaScript and CSS bundles
- ✅ `images/` - Image assets including episode thumbnails
- ✅ `audio/` - Audio file directory

## SPA Routing Configuration ✅

The application is correctly configured as a Single Page Application:

1. ✅ **404.html Fallback**: All unknown routes serve 404.html (which is a copy of index.html), allowing React Router to handle routing
2. ✅ **Client-Side Navigation**: Navigation handled by JavaScript, not server redirects
3. ✅ **Single HTML Entry Point**: All routes load through index.html
4. ✅ **No Jekyll Processing**: The .nojekyll file ensures GitHub Pages doesn't process files as a Jekyll site

## Workflow Architecture ✅

```

### Separation of Concerns
- **ci.yml**: Validates code quality (type checking, linting, security scans)
- **deploy.yml**: Handles production deployment to GitHub Pages
- No conflicts or race conditions
