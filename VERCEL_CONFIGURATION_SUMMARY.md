# Vercel Configuration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Vercel configuration and Supabase integration that was set up for the Jobbyist Beta application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Supabase Credentials

The application has been configured with new Supabase credentials:

- **Supabase URL**: `https://xzlyudwzhbqsdlwpfmwk.supabase.co`
- **Project ID**: `xzlyudwzhbqsdlwpfmwk`
- **Anon Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inh6bHl1ZHd6aGJxc2Rsd3BmbXdrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkzNzQ5MjIsImV4cCI6MjA3NDk1MDkyMn0.3wxOZAi8yMn2iJQYExXCBHcciWgaPc4z1ReIYfknBqc`

### 2. Created Vercel Configuration File

**File**: `vercel.json`

The configuration file includes:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Framework: Vite
- Environment variables for Supabase connection
- SPA routing support with rewrites
- Cache headers for optimized asset delivery

### 3. Updated Environment Files

**Files Updated**:
- `.env` - Local development environment (updated with new credentials)
- `.env.example` - Template for new developers (updated with new credentials)

### 4. Created Documentation

**File**: `VERCEL_SETUP.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Quick setup steps for Vercel deployment
- Environment variable configuration
- Supabase connection details
- Testing instructions
- Vercel CLI usage
- Troubleshooting guide
- Custom domain setup
- Continuous deployment information

### 5. Updated README

**File**: `README.md`

Added:
- Reference to VERCEL_SETUP.md in documentation section
- Vercel as an alternative deployment option
- Updated Technologies section to include Vercel

## Supabase Connection

The application already has a properly configured Supabase client at `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`. This client automatically uses the environment variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`

No code changes were needed to the Supabase client as it was already properly implemented to use environment variables.

### Supabase Edge Functions Integration

The application uses three Supabase Edge Functions that work seamlessly with Vercel deployments:

1. **job-scraper** - Scrapes and imports job listings from partner sites
2. **job-cleanup** - Removes old job listings (runs daily at 3 AM UTC)
3. **seed-jobs** - Seeds database with sample job listings

**Deployment Architecture:**
- Frontend (React app) is deployed to Vercel
- Edge Functions are deployed to Supabase via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/supabase-deploy.yml`)
- Frontend calls Edge Functions via HTTP API
- Edge Functions process requests and interact with the Supabase database

**Note:** Edge Functions are NOT deployed to Vercel. They run on Supabase infrastructure and are called by the frontend via HTTP requests.

### Database Migrations Integration

Database migrations are automatically applied via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to `main` branch:

- Location: `supabase/migrations/`
- Deployment: `.github/workflows/supabase-deploy.yml`
- Includes: Schema definitions, RLS policies, storage configuration, initial data

**Note:** Migrations are NOT run by Vercel. They are applied directly to the Supabase database via the Supabase CLI in GitHub Actions.

For detailed information about how Edge Functions and migrations integrate with Vercel, see **[VERCEL_SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md](VERCEL_SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md)**.

## Testing the Connection

The Supabase connection can be tested using the browser console:

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js/+esm';

const supabase = createClient(
  'https://xzlyudwzhbqsdlwpfmwk.supabase.co',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inh6bHl1ZHd6aGJxc2Rsd3BmbXdrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkzNzQ5MjIsImV4cCI6MjA3NDk1MDkyMn0.3wxOZAi8yMn2iJQYExXCBHcciWgaPc4z1ReIYfknBqc'
);

// Test query
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('todos').select();
console.log('Data:', data, 'Error:', error);
```

## Deployment Options

The application now supports two deployment options:

### 1. GitHub Pages (Current)
- Automatically deploys on push to `main` branch
- Custom domain: jobbyist.africa
- Configured via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### 2. Vercel (New)
- Can be deployed via Vercel dashboard or CLI
- Environment variables configured in `vercel.json`
- Preview deployments for all pull requests
- Edge network for optimal performance

## Next Steps

To deploy to Vercel:

1. Sign up at https://vercel.com
2. Import the `jobbyist/jobbyist-beta` repository
3. Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
4. Add any additional environment variables in Vercel dashboard (optional)
5. Click "Deploy"

For detailed instructions, see [VERCEL_SETUP.md](VERCEL_SETUP.md).

## Security Notes

- The Supabase anon key is safe to expose in client-side code
- Only provides access to public data and authenticated operations
- Never expose the Supabase service role key in client-side code
- For sensitive operations, use Supabase Edge Functions

## Verification

The configuration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ Supabase client is properly initialized
- ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
- ✅ README is updated with deployment information

## Files Modified

1. `.env` - Updated with new Supabase credentials
2. `.env.example` - Updated with new Supabase credentials
3. `vercel.json` - Created with Vercel configuration (updated with GitHub integration)
4. `VERCEL_SETUP.md` - Created with deployment documentation (updated with Edge Functions and migrations information)
5. `VERCEL_SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md` - Comprehensive guide for Supabase integration with Vercel
6. `VERCEL_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file (updated with Edge Functions and migrations details)
7. `README.md` - Updated with Vercel information

No code changes were required as the application was already properly set up to use environment variables for Supabase configuration.
