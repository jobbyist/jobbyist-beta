# Jobbyist Platform - Production Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing the Jobbyist platform in a production environment. The platform is a React-based job search application for the South African market with integrated audio content capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v6

### Backend Services
- **Primary Backend**: Supabase (BaaS)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Functions (Deno runtime)

### Additional Services
- **Payment Processing**: PayPal SDK
- **AI Enhancement**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus + Loki
- **Caching**: Redis (for production scalability)

## Prerequisites

### Required Accounts & Services
1. **Supabase**: Create project and obtain API keys
2. **PayPal Developer**: Set up merchant account and obtain client ID
3. **OpenAI**: API key for job description enhancement
4. **Google Analytics**: GA4 property for tracking
5. **Domain & SSL**: Production domain with SSL certificate

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Create production environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
```

Configure the following variables:

```env
# Application
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_APP_NAME=Jobbyist
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# Supabase (Production)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# PayPal (Production)
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_paypal_client_id

# Analytics & Monitoring
VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn

# OpenAI (Server-side only)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

#### Database Schema
Run the provided migrations in order:
```sql
-- Execute migrations in supabase/migrations/ directory
-- in chronological order
```

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
Ensure RLS policies are properly configured:
- Users can only access their own data
- Jobs are publicly readable
- Admin functions are restricted

#### Edge Functions
Deploy the job scraper function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy job-scraper
```

#### Storage Buckets
Create required storage buckets:
- `audio-episodes` (for podcast files)
- `user-avatars` (for profile pictures)
- `company-logos` (for job listings)

## Build & Deployment

### 1. GitHub Pages (Current Setup)

The application is currently configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy automatically via GitHub Actions
# Triggered on push to main branch
```

### 2. Docker Deployment (Recommended for Production)

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t jobbyist-app .

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or run individual container
docker run -p 8080:8080 jobbyist-app
```

### 3. Cloud Platform Deployment

#### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Netlify
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Upload to S3 bucket
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

## Production Optimization
