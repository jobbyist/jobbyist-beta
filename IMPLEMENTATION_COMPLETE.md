# ✅ PR Redeployment System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive system to redeploy the last 5 pull requests (PRs #20-24) in the jobbyist/jobbyist-beta repository with the current build configuration.

## Problem Statement Addressed

**Requirement:** "Redeploy the last 5 pull requests in this repository starting from PR #24 with the current configuration build"

**Solution:** Created a GitHub Actions workflow that enables manual redeployment of any or all of these PRs using the latest production configuration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Redeployment Workflow (`.github/workflows/redeploy-pr.yml`)

A production-ready GitHub Actions workflow with:

#### Features:
- ✅ **Single PR Deployment** - Select any PR from 20-24 for individual redeployment
- ✅ **Batch Deployment** - Deploy all 5 PRs sequentially with one trigger
- ✅ **Current Configuration** - Uses latest production secrets and environment variables
- ✅ **Original Code** - Deploys from exact PR merge commits
- ✅ **SPA Support** - Maintains client-side routing and custom domain
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging** - Displays PR info, build progress, deployment status

#### Pull Requests Covered:

| PR # | Title | Merge Commit | Main Features |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| #24 | Security fixes and audio player | `6dadd4aa` | DOMPurify XSS protection, audio player, episodes page |
| #23 | PWA and Jobbyist Pro | `0098c4c4` | PWA manifest, service worker, PayPal Pro, job automation |
| #22 | ESLint fixes and SEO | `b25c12d9` | React hooks fixes, logo updates, SEO optimization |
| #21 | Footer and company directory | `adc80f2d` | Footer navigation, company directory, Nigerian cities |
