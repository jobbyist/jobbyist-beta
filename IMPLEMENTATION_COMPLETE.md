# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to implement the requirements from the problem statement.

## ✅ Completed Requirements

### 1. Footer Link Updates

#### Locations Section
**Changed from:** Johannesburg, Cape Town, Lagos, Pretoria  
**Changed to:** Johannesburg, Cape Town, Abuja, Lagos

All location links now filter the `/jobs` page by location using query parameters:
- `/jobs?location=Johannesburg`
- `/jobs?location=Cape%20Town`
- `/jobs?location=Abuja`
- `/jobs?location=Lagos`

#### Job Types Section
**Changed from:** Full-time Jobs, Part-time Jobs, Remote Jobs, Contract Jobs  
**Changed to:** Full Time, Part Time, Remote, Contract

Links properly filter the `/jobs` page:
- Full Time → `/jobs?type=full-time`
- Part Time → `/jobs?type=part-time`
- Remote → `/jobs?remote=true` (boolean filter)
- Contract → `/jobs?type=contract`

#### Services Section
**Changed from:**
- Job Search (modal trigger)
- Resume Audit (external link)
- Upgrade To Pro
- Company Directory

**Changed to:**
- Browse Job Listings → `/jobs`
- Upgrade To Pro → `/pro`
- Resume/CV Builder → `/builder`
- Company Directory → `/companies`

### 2. Policy and Settings Pages

All required pages already exist and are properly linked in the footer's "Legal Stuff" section:
- ✅ Privacy Policy → `/privacy-policy`
- ✅ Terms of Service → `/terms-of-service`
- ✅ Cookie Policy → `/cookie-policy`
- ✅ Data Protection → `/data-protection`

These pages contain comprehensive content with proper SEO metadata and are fully functional.

### 3. Company Directory Page

**New Page:** `/companies` (src/pages/CompanyDirectory.tsx)

Features:
- Displays all 5 companies from the homepage:
  1. Deloitte (Global)
  2. Vodacom Group (South Africa)
  3. Access Bank (Nigeria)
  4. Capitec Bank (South Africa)
  5. Amazon (Global)

- Search functionality to filter companies by name or location
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Company cards with:
  - Logo images
  - Company name
  - Location
  - Hover effects and animations
  - Links to individual company profile pages

- SEO optimization with proper title, meta description, and canonical URL
- Additional information section about the directory

### 4. Database Connection

**New File:** `src/db.js`

Contains Supabase PostgreSQL connection setup using the `postgres` library:
```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres'

const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://postgres:quxbe5-xuqjah-giDbiw@db.aznouacxayahvisuczie.supabase.co:5432/postgres'
const sql = postgres(connectionString)

export default sql
```

### 5. GitHub Secrets Documentation

**New File:** `GITHUB_SECRETS.md`

Comprehensive documentation for all required GitHub repository secrets:
- SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
- VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID

Includes:
- Complete values for each secret
- Step-by-step instructions for adding secrets to GitHub
- Security notes and best practices
- Purpose and description of each secret

### 6. Location Filter Enhancement

**Modified File:** `src/components/JobFilters.tsx`

Added Nigerian cities to the location dropdown:
- Lagos
- Abuja

This ensures that when users click the footer location links, they can see and select these cities in the filter dropdown.

## 📝 Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. `src/pages/CompanyDirectory.tsx` - New company directory page
2. `src/db.js` - Database connection configuration
3. `GITHUB_SECRETS.md` - Secrets documentation

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Updated all footer sections with new links
2. `src/components/JobFilters.tsx` - Added Lagos and Abuja to locations
3. `src/App.tsx` - Added route for `/companies` page

### Query Parameter Mapping
The Jobs page (`src/pages/Jobs.tsx`) already supports query parameters:
- `location` - Filter by location
- `type` - Filter by job type
- `remote` - Filter remote jobs (boolean)
- `q` - Search query
- `level` - Experience level
- `skills` - Skills filter

All footer links use these parameters correctly.

### Build Status
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ ESLint shows only pre-existing warnings (unrelated to changes)
- ⚠️ Pre-existing test failures (AuthProvider setup issue in tests - not related to changes)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### GitHub Secrets
GitHub repository secrets **cannot be added programmatically** through the API or automation. They must be added manually through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each secret with the values provided in GITHUB_SECRETS.md

### Database Connection
The `src/db.js` file is configured but will need the `postgres` npm package to be installed if not already present:
```bash
npm install postgres
```

### Testing
The existing test suite has pre-existing failures related to missing AuthProvider setup in test fixtures. These failures existed before the changes and are not caused by this implementation. All changes follow the pattern of existing code and should not introduce new test failures.
