## 🚀 Setup for Development

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Copy audio files** (already done):
   - Files in `public/audio/` (excluded from git)
   - Thumbnails in `public/images/thumbnails/`

3. **Environment variables** (.env):
   ```bash
   VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   ```

4. **Run migrations** (in Supabase):
   ```sql
   -- Add transcript field
   \i supabase/migrations/20250128000000_add_transcript_to_audio_episodes.sql
   
   -- Seed episodes
   \i supabase/migrations/20250128000001_seed_initial_episodes.sql
   ```

5. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📦 Production Deployment

1. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=live_production_client_id
   ```

2. **Apply database migrations** via Supabase dashboard

3. **Upload audio files** via admin interface at `/admin/audio-upload`

4. **Verify HTTPS** - Secure cookies only work with HTTPS

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why are audio files not in git?**
A: They're 5MB+ each. Use Supabase Storage for production or local files for dev.

**Q: How do I add new episodes?**
A: Use the admin interface at `/admin/audio-upload` (requires admin privileges).

**Q: Why do I see "your-paypal-client-id" error?**
A: Set `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file.

**Q: Do I need to run migrations?**
A: Yes, apply both migrations in Supabase for transcript support and episode seeding.

**Q: Will volume/likes sync across devices?**
A: No, they're stored in localStorage. Consider backend sync for future update.

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. npm vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (esbuild, vite) - Not production-critical
2. Audio files must be manually uploaded to Supabase Storage for production
3. IE11 support limited to basic playback only

## 💡 Tips

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Space = play/pause, Arrow keys = seek
- **Mobile**: All controls work on touch devices
- **Offline**: Download button saves episode to localStorage
- **Speed range**: 0.5x (half speed) to 2.0x (double speed)

## 🎯 Next Steps

Consider adding:
- Server-side play count tracking
- User-specific like/dislike sync to database
- Audio waveform visualization
- Podcast RSS feed
- Playlist functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Remember playback position per episode
